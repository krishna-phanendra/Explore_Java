Lambda Expression:
------------------
Lambda Expression are the way through which we can visualize functional programming in the 
java object oriented world. Objects are the base of java programming language and we can never have 
a function without an Object, that’s why Java language provide support for using lambda expressions 
only with functional interfaces.
