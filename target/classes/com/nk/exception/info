- The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so 
  that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
- In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object 
  which is thrown at runtime.
- An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a 
  program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.

  Types of Java Exceptions: 
  -------------------------
  	- Checked Exception - The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException
  						  and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException 
  						  etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
  						  
	- Unchecked Exception - The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked 
							exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, 
							ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. 
							Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are 
							checked at runtime.
	- Error - Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
